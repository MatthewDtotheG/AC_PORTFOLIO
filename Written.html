        <h2>PERCEPTION
        <br>AND CONCEPTION</h2>

        <p>
            By studying methods of producing optical illusions, and the psychological and physiological mechanisms that create them, I have developed a better understanding of how I construct my reality. These paintings use photographs as recordings taken in the American Southwest to create a new experience that affects my memory of New Mexico and Arizona. This separation from a former reality develops my current perceptions, and the memory is experienced as an incomplete recording of the previous. These images are presented to the viewer with or without prior knowledge of the area, leading into a new memory. The link between mathematics, science, and art enables the viewer to immerse his or her self in an alternate form of reality.

        <h2>Visual Inquiry into Perceptions of Reality</h2>
        <br>

        <p class="PQUOTE">
            Inquiry Question: How does visual perception and distortion of reality cause us to react differently in various environments and in different situations?
        </p>
        <p>
            As I began this process of inquiry, I felt that the basic physiological construct of our senses should be the first place to investigate, and while it has resulted in a product, this paper is not a final examination of visual perception. As a curious species, humans are continually reinventing former perceptions of reality through Humanism, Neuroscience, and Theoretical Physics. Due to the numerous fields from which to draw upon, whose overall structure resembles the rhizome (Duncum, 2012), I have chosen to focus on the biology of our eyes, our brains’ translation of sensory information, and how they produce affect.
        </p>



        <p>
            Visual perception begins as light enters the eye through the lens. The light reaches the inside of the eye opposite to the object perceived and is absorbed by rod and cone receptors that measure value and color. These send an electrical impulse corresponding to their location within the eye through the optic nerve. The optic nerves cross at the optic Chiasm, which connects the right and left halves of each retina to their respective hemispheres of the brain. The journey ends at the visual center of the brain where the electrical impulses are translated into the images we perceive.
        </p>




        <p>
            C. R. Nave (2014) describes the inner layer of the eye, called the retina, as comprising of rod cells that only measure value, cone cells that primarily measure color/hue and intensity, and the optic nerve. The distribution of cones and rods is not even across the retina and are measured at six to seven million and 120 million, respectively. In the center there is a .3 mm area containing only cones that are densely packed. This area, known as the fovea centralis, is highly adapt at absorbing colors, but poorly measures levels of light. This is noticeable at night when starlights disappear when looked at directly but reappear when observed peripherally. Surrounding the fovea centralis is an area containing both rods and cones providing most of our visual information. The rods enable our night vision, peripheral vision, and “our most sensitive motion detection” (Nave, 2014, Rod and Cone Density on Retina section, para.1).
        </p>




        <p>
            Distortion comes in a variety of modes: physiological, mental, and emotional distortions are produced internal to the perceiver, being that they are produced by observational experience from sensory information or affected based on the functionality of our brain as a translating mechanism. The distortions produced by the human body are also interrelated as emotional and physiological distortions affect the mental capacity to comprehend an image, an environment, or a situation objectively. Here I will primarily discuss those distortions as illusions that are a direct result from the eye’s structure and the brain’s capability to translate this sensory information.
        </p>




        <p>
            One readily available optical illusion is when the moon ascends in the sky while its position is just above the horizon. Martinez-Conde and Macknik (2013) write that size is relative in optical illusions. They state that when the moon is observed within the context of a landscape, positioned next to trees and other familiar structures, it appears large. At the height of its ascension, the open sky, clouds, and starlight surround the moon. In this context the moon is perceived as relatively small compared to the vastness of the sky. So while we understand that the moon remains a constant size and distance away from us in space, without some basic understanding of physics we might have assumed that the moon shrinks or becomes significantly more distant at its height. This information exposes the optical illusion through the use of verifiable measurements of distance and size made by instruments relative to a standard. Without the standard, or taken out of context, the perceived objects appear to change.
        </p>




        <p>
            Relativity expresses itself as a mental construct when observing colors under different conditions. Macknik and Martinez-Conde (2013) discuss this phenomenon when taking a neutral grey shape out of its monochromatic setting and surrounding it with a red tint. The grey appears to change to a turquoise blue due to the relative color change of the environment. The electrical signals sent by the eye are compared to one another through multiple brain processes called the opponent process. This effect allows the perceiver to develop a consistent understanding of his or her surroundings under a variety of situations including: dim or bright lighting conditions and in the context of saturated/ neutral brightness levels. When Albers (2013) writes about this same phenomenon he compares it to another experiment that can be easily replicated. By sticking one of your hands in a bucket of cold water and the other in a bucket of hot water, each hand feels one of the extremes, but feels the opposite when immediately placed in a third bucket of room temperature water. While these illusions require sufficient exposure, in either quantity or duration, they all prove that information is made relevant to contextual evidence.
        </p>



        <p>
           As lighting levels decrease, image resolution diminishes where peripheral vision is strongest due to the rods’ light and motion sensitivity. Another simple visual distortion experiment, as provided by Nave (2014), can be observed in a rose at twilight. In this limited lighting condition, the cones in the fovea centralis begin to shut down, leaving most of our vision up to the rods’ detection. The rods do not detect the color red, resulting in a muted rose and more visually saturated green leaves. On a daily basis we are confronted with a barrage of visual information. The reception of this information is limited by the physical capabilities of our eyes, the mental constructs developed to help make sense of our environment, and our brain’s filter to prevent overstimulation that results in our perception of reality.
        </p>



        <p>
           Once we begin to understand how we make these actions consciously, we begin to construct a vision of the world outside of ourselves. Kant (as cited in Philosophies of Art and Beauty, 1964) argued that this cognitive separation is however false because the entirety of human experience is an experience perceived and translated from sensory information, which builds our empirical knowledge around an object of experience. This is a huge issue in self-perception and perception of others. For the ‘normal’ human, as opposed to the minority with physiological, mental, or emotional/behavioral disorders stunting this perception, it is easy to accept the view that we are observers of the world. As the individual becomes conscious of their thoughts, they hold the world separate from their intuitions, containing some noumenon: a thing in itself that cannot be experienced with our senses (as mentioned by Kaufman, Personal Communication, November 13th, 2014). It is thusly impossible to imagine something outside of our experience until sensed by our internal senses (vision, hearing, etc.) or external sensory mechanisms (technology detecting x-rays, radiation, microwaves, etc.) that make it possible to perceive with our given senses. At this junction the noumenon becomes the phenomenon.
        </p>




        <p>
            As visual artists, we create images that represent physical objects, emotions, or concepts related to our reality, but what happens when the images precede our experience of reality? They, in effect, become the thing of reality, which then frames our understanding of the experience, if we ever even experience it (Baudrillard, 2010). Baudrillard discusses this topic at length as he relates simulation-gone-wrong to numerous factors in our society and culture. When a simulation (an object or image that represents something or some experience) is viewed prior to the experience of origin it is called a simulacra. These simulacra can also be described as a simulation of a simulation, where the experience of the simulation is mistaken for and replaces the actual experience.
        </p>




        <p>
            As I applied this concept to art, it seems to deem all representational art that precedes an experience as a false representation of reality. This can be counteracted in a few ways: firstly, by having the experience prior to the representation. Secondly, by creating images of pure abstraction that are the origin of their experience. And thirdly, by consciously integrating the idea that the representations/simulations we encounter are in no way the original experience into our schema that we use to perceive reality. The first two options provide quick results with some moderately long-lasting. However, the third is a process in reframing how we understand news, narratives, the visual arts, and all other second source material, which will take a great amount of effort and time but with diligent practice render the most permanent results.
        </p>




        <p>
            Sontag (1966) believes scientific/logical understanding (as opposed to an experiential and emotional understanding) of reality lurks behind the interpretive impulse that she is against. She states that the reason individuals interpret a piece of artwork is because the work does not fit contemporary needs and therefore must be reinterpreted/ not taken at face value. In an example provided by Sontag (1966), the writer Kafka is often revisited under the interpretations as a psychoanalytic or religious allegory. These interpretations provide different resulting understandings of the work and are derived from a mindset that is projected onto Kafka, his life, background, and beliefs. Sontag believes this is the modern way of thinking, not just a way of acknowledging genius, but the new standard for understanding pieces of art. She makes an argument through Pop and Abstract Art for sensuality and experience. Both of these genres aim to render an experience by either duplicating imagery out of context to nullify meaning or by eliminating recognizable forms respectively, which only the latter aim would agree with Baudrillard (2010).
        </p>


        <p>
            The problems that simulacra pose to our understanding of reality can be summed by saying, “in a phrase, perception and conception are inseparable. Hence, knowledge shapes perception and vice versa” (Davis, Luce-Kapler, &amp; Sumara, 2008, pg. 23). By framing this quote around knowledge, the authors question its implication in the educational process. How does this affect the way we teach? How do we learn? I believe by exploring visual culture with our students, they will gain further insight into how they learn and how experience changes their perceptions of others and of themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand our environment is to understand the majority of our visual culture. As I taught a lesson at Kickapoo High School (Holli Dunn, Portfolio Course, Personal Communication, October 23rd, 2014), I asked the students to briefly describe the visual aspect of their homes. Some students talked about what was covering the walls inside their home and another student spoke about her backyard. In discussing the different environments frequented by the students, they began to translate how their environment affected them. One girl found the blue peacock wallpaper in her home tacky, but also found that it was calming. She did not care for this environment as she is much more productive in a visually and auditorily stimulating environment. She recognized that she needed people moving around, talking, and to have music playing so that she could focus. The second student, who related her backyard to a very peaceful environment, contrasted this place with her school environment, which she considered to be stressful and noisy. By asking and answering the question, “how does your environment affect your mood/behavior” the students were able to gain a better understanding of their visual culture and their selves.

            When we were asked to present over artists who produced affect, I was drawn to the work of Yayoi Kusama, a Japanese born woman who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression as a child (Pappas, 2012). Her culture developed from all of these major aspects of her life creating a diverse personality. Her paintings and installations incorporate an abstract use of pattern, shape, and color to create new environments for the viewers to experience. I found the spaces she created, on painting surfaces and in her installations, bordered on optical illusions by using the elements listed above. The original intention in presenting over Kusama was to relate her highly specific cultural background to her artwork and to the audience. Through the presentation and Kusama’s artwork we gained a better visual understanding what it is like to have schizophrenia and function within the spaces we create.

            In creating compositions, Western aesthetics typically states that an object should not be placed directly in the center of the picture plane from all four sides. The eye immediately travels there searching for stability and finds it. However, once found, the eye becomes visually locked into position and will be hard pressed to explore the rest of the picture plane without reverting back to this state. Asymmetrical balance is therefore prized as a counterpoint allowing the eye to roam as if within a natural environment, but controlled by the artist’s choices of depiction and compositional development through the elements and principles of design. This is an attempt to simulate the affect the natural environment places upon the perceiver, directing the eye through the image. The artist depicting environments recognizes this and makes an aesthetic choice to limit the field of view within the 2-Dimensional picture plane, the base physical limitation of humans being the full periphery of the eyes and the eye-sockets within which they are seated.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my own artistic practice, I am interested in how visual perception can be represented and what is the merit in doing so. I became more observant of my visual perception when I stumbled on the stereopsis phenomenon, where two images taken of the same scene/object and at slightly different positions are overlapped to create a single perceivable image that helps define 3-Dimensional space. I had heard of the phenomenon before, but the reason it stuck in my head, was I found I could perceive this effect from my own eyes while focusing at a further distance than the object being observed.
        </p>

        <p>
            I began to draw diagrams explaining how to represent this effect visually in a single image and paint by observing with my periphery. While some executions were more successful, they all created an interesting sense of space surrounding the viewer and sought to flush out a visual solution based on science, mathematics, and aesthetics based in the nature of our perceivable reality. The first sketch illustrating these ideas was of my computer, whose edge was observed bending slightly upward and fanning outward. I noticed the curve on the top of my computer screen increased the further to the side of my field of vision (in the ‘y’ direction on the Cartesian Coordinate Plane) the computer was positioned. I also recorded that the fanned edges grew apart (on the ‘x’ plane) in distance the further back I focused in space (the ‘z’ plane). This change in overlapping based on where my eyes focused showed that it was possible to create a visual sense of depth by representing the stereopsis phenomenon to various degrees within the picture plane.
        </p>

        <p>
           I recognized this technique would depend entirely on the relational accuracy in rendering and the paint application of all the edges of objects within the environment. It was also obvious this would be more easily achieved with geometrically simple objects (books, cups, etc.) and complex shapes, like the leaves on a tree, would be far more difficult because of the edge’s irregularity and the number of leaves. A simple still life is easiest to explore this technique, layering objects backward in space and outward to the four edges of the picture plane. When observing the still life, the focus depth of the perceiver’s eye should be limited to one object’s position, which will develop a relative sense of space to the focus object. The observer can then look around the scene, retaining that focal depth, to observe how separate the two images produced by our eyes become.
        </p>

        <p>
           As the eye begins to grow accustomed to observing its environment/ a still life with a single depth of focus, it becomes possible for the eye to judge the entire scene based on its peripheral vision. This is accomplished by once again choosing a single object to focus on within a space while the observer retains his or her gaze on this single spot. This is difficult to practice due to the eye’s naturally continuous movement to provide the highest resolution image, keeping the object within the fovea centralis (Nave, 2014). The rest of the scene is perceived out of the corners of the eyes. In the periphery, straight lines appear to curve around the viewer, the stereopsis effect is exposed, saturation levels are diminished, and stark value differences are increased.
